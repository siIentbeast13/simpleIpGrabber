# simpleIpGrabber
Easily ip grab people


To using this is fairly simple. Run main.py and host it on your device. Port forward it using things like ngrok.
When a user enters the site his info will be appended to a file called ips.txt


Feel free to change the code. I have provided comments to help with that.



Happy crimes.
